\section{Four Key Current Directions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fundementally secure/reliable/safe architectuers
\item Fundementally energy-efficent and memory centric architectures
\item Fundementally low latency and predictable archiectures
\item Architectures for AI/ML, Genomics, Medicine, etc.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Transformation Hierarchy}

The order travels through different hierarchical levels until it reaches the electrons. From problems to algorithms, thrugh program/language to system software to SW/HW Interface to lower hardware components.\\

Computer architecture was traditionally limited to SW/HW Interface and to Micro-architecture, but in the present day, computer architecture expands from algorithms to devices. This is because, to achieve the highest energy efficency and performance, one must take the expanded view therefore co-designing across the hierarchy.\\

This way, once can specialize most of the components for a specific domain.

\section{Computer Architecture}

Computer architecture is the science and art of designin computing platforms to achibe a set of design goals. Designing a supercomputer is different from designing a smartphone, but many fundemental principles are similiar.\\

The computer architecture allows better systems to be built by making computer faster, cheaper, smaller and more reliable, it enables new applications and enables better solutions to be found.\\

Studying computer architecutre allows one to understand why computers work the way they do.

\subsection{Computer Architecture Today}

The present day industry has entered a paradigm shift to novel architectures, as many difficult problems motivate and cause a demand for novel architectures.
