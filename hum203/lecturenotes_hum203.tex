\chapter{What is Antrophology}
Antropholoy is the study of humankind everywhere throughout time, steaming from Anthro (human) + logos (science of). In a world where most people live in multicultural and multiethnic states, importance of antrophology has increased.

Antrophology asks questions like:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Why are humans and cultures similar? (such as most cultures having marriage rituals)
\item Why are humans and cultures different? (such as differences between these rituals)
\item How does societies and cultures change, evolve and adopt.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Fields of Antropology}

Antrophology looks at the human experience in a broad manner, encompassing different systems of humanity with its psychological, cultural, social, biological and physical aspects. It is divided into fields such as:


\begin{itemize}
\item Cultural Antrophology
\item Archaeology
\item Linguistic Antrophology
\item Biological Antrophology
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physical (Biological) Anthropology}

The systemic study of humans as biological organisms.

\subsubsection{Primotology}

Study of non-human primates. From lemurs to gorillas. They study these animals in the wild and in captivity. Primitalogists analyse how animals spend their time, how they behave.\\

Primotologists are concerned about extinction.

\subsubsection{Paleoanthropology}

Study of human evolution, including hominids.

\subsubsection{Contemporary Human Genetic Field}

They study the contemporory human genetics and biological makeup across diferent cultures and population groups.

\subsection{Archaeology}

The study of past human cultures through their material remains. It has two different subfields, pre-historic and historic archeologists. Divided by the time the writing started. The pre-historical archaeologists generaly define themselves with broad geographic zones.\\

Archeology may also be subdivided with respect to the specific field they research, such as industrial archeology or such as underwater archeology.

\subsection{Linguistic Anthropology}

The study of human languages, they look at their structure, history and relation to social and cultural contexts, as well its contemporary change. Language is the primary way humans communicate with each other, forming a basis of human cultures.

\subsection{Cultural Anthropology}

The study of customary patterns, thought and feelings, it focus on humans as culture-producing and culture-reproducing creatures. Cultural anthropologists spent time in the culture they research as field work, called \textit{Participant Observation}\unsure.
